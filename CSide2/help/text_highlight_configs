This text editor has a very primative and sort of broken text highlighting feature. Just place your highlighting format file in the folder called "highlighters". And you can load up the file in the command line with "hl {}".

The formatting for the highlighter file is as follows:
{COLOR} {KEYWORD}
or 
quote {COLOR}

These are the supported colors: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white, brightred, brightgreen, brightyellow, brightblue, brightmagenta, brightcyan, brightwhite

Example file:
    quote cyan
    blue char
    blue short
    blue int
    blue long
    blue float
    blue double
    yellow void
    yellow unsigned
    yellow const
    yellow auto
    red if
    red else
    red break
    red continue
    red while
    red for
